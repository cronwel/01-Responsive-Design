Purpose: Review responsive design principles and ensure I have a good grasp.

Methods: This was an on-line tutorial available through http://youtube.com.

Ref: Ryan, Drew. "How To Make a Website Start To Finish - Responsive HTML5/CSS3, Image Slider & Drop Down Menu."  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R-qmsvtSaQ. Dec 30, 2014.

Results: A good tutorial overall, however, the strategy used was approached using older methods of accomplishing responsive design. Flexbox and other flex attributes were not used but were capable of accomplishing the same type of responsive web design you can expect. The video accomplished the main objectives. It did use an older an potentially dangerous approach of combining all of the code onto one page. As in, HTML, CSS, and Javascript were all on a single page of HTML5. From my training, I know that this is not the preferred method of creating HTML documents.

Blocks: I was hung up at one point regarding the functionality of the Javascript code. I forgot a period after writing the method. Otherwise, the tutorial played out congruent to what I was doing.
